Functions are described in the following format.
[Event] + [Ghost Name]
Events include the following:
Depending on the event, if there is no corresponding function, it will be OnClose or OnBoot.
Ghost names are prefixed with _.
If there is no corresponding ghost name, the ghost name part is "Other".

"Or 'in the name, or +-/ *, single-byte space, etc.
Any characters used in the system will be converted to _.
Example: the "MobileMaster"-> OnGhostChanging_the__MobileMaster_

OnGhostChanging When trying to switch to another ghost. If not, OnClose is called.
OnGhostChanged When switching from another ghost. If not, OnBoot is called.
OnGhostCalling when trying to call another ghost
OnGhostCalled When called from another ghost. If not, OnBoot is called.
OnGhostCallComplete Calls another ghost, and when the called ghost completes launching, instead of OnOtherGhostBooted

OnOtherGhostBooted When another ghost is called and the called ghost has finished booting
OnOtherGhostClosed when another ghost is closed
OnOtherGhostChanged When another ghost switches to another ghost and the startup of the ghost to be switched to is completed
