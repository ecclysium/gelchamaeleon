Gel is a ghost in perpetual motion. They are here to sit around on your desktop, yes, however...
They are a very reactive ghost. They want to see what you are doing on your computer, and will
get upset when you're away. They're more than happy to greet you when you come back, though!
Being in a computer is weird and all, but with some well placed greetings and thank-yous, 
they'll warm right up.

Gel can be pet, punched, and poked depending on movement type and location.
